# ðŸŒ± Agricultural Impact Simulator  

**Module: Agroecology & Sustainability**

---

## 1. Overview

The Agricultural Impact Simulator is an interactive platform designed to model and predict the impact of sustainable agricultural practices on both the environment and production.  

It combines:

- A **robust backend API**  
- An **interactive frontend**  
- An **AI prediction engine**  

---

## 2. Objectives

- Simulate the impact of sustainable farming practices  
- Provide real-time visualizations of results  
- Predict environmental and production outcomes using AI models  
- Compare conventional vs. sustainable agricultural approaches  

---

## 3. Features

- **Project management**: create and configure agricultural projects  
- **Custom parameters**: crop type, soil type, surface area, climate, sustainable practices  
- **AI-based predictions**: yield, COâ‚‚ emissions, biodiversity, soil health  
- **Interactive visualizations**: charts and indicators with scenario comparisons  
- **Recommendations**: automated suggestions for alternative practices  
- **Iterative simulation**: modify parameters and instantly see updated results

## 4. Architecture

### Backend

- RESTful API (Node.js/Express)  
- Database support (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)  
- Data model for crops, soils, climate, practices, and environmental indicators  
- Integration of AI models  

### Frontend

- React.js interface  
- User-friendly forms for parameter input  
- Data visualization with Recharts / Chart.js / D3.js  
- Scenario comparison dashboard  

### AI Engine

- Predictive models: regression, decision trees, time series analysis  
- Evaluation of agroecological impact  
- Continuous improvement with historical data

## 5. Workflow

1. **Project Definition**  
   - User creates a new project  
   - Input of agricultural parameters (crop, soil, surface, practices, climate)  

2. **Simulation & Prediction**  
   - Parameters are stored and processed by the backend  
   - AI engine generates predictions on yield, emissions, biodiversity, soil status  
   - Results stored and made accessible in real time  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Interactive charts and metrics in the React interface  
   - Scenario comparison (e.g., conventional vs. sustainable)  
   - Automated recommendations  

4. **Optimization**  
   - User adjusts parameters  
   - New predictions are generated instantly  
   - Results feed into a growing knowledge base to refine models

## 6. Deliverables

- Complete and documented backend API  
- Responsive and user-friendly frontend interface  
- Integrated and documented AI engine  
- Full technical documentation  

---

## 7. Technologies & Tools

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **Frontend**: React.js, Recharts, Chart.js, D3.js  
- **AI/ML**: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Others**: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), Jest for testing
